# Linear fitter

An old code added to GitHub years later it was written. Code was written in early 2014.

It's a graphical desktop application written in C# for linear regression. The language is Hungarian. You need to enter the `x` and `y` values in a table (using **comma** as the decimal separator!). When you click on "Kiszámít" (calculate) it gives you the parameters of the fitted line. (Line is fitten in an exact analytical way, not with iterative algotithm.) It also gives you the partial results you would use if you calculate manually. This software was written to ease university laboratory reports where you have to demonstrate the process of the calculation. It even contains the used formula as images.
